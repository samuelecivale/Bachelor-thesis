# Bachelor Thesis: Design and Development of a PID Controller for Robot Kicker

Welcome to the repository showcasing my bachelor thesis titled **"Design and development of a PID controller to optimise the approach to the ball in robot kicker shooting"**. This document presents the research, development, and results of my thesis project, implemented in C++.

## Overview

This thesis explores the creation of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller designed to enhance the performance of a robot kicker system. The controller aims to improve the precision and efficiency of the ball approach and shooting process in robotic applications.

## Contents

- **Thesis PDF**: The main document of the thesis detailing the design, implementation, and evaluation of the PID controller.
  - `Bachelor_Thesis_PID_Controller.pdf`: Comprehensive report including introduction, methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Purpose

This repository is intended to provide access to the thesis document for recruiters, potential collaborators, and anyone interested in the detailed work behind the PID controller for robot kickers. It includes:

- An in-depth explanation of the PID control theory applied to robotics.
- C++ implementation details and results from the simulation and testing phases.

## Accessing the Document
